Description: This webpage showcases some of the best (in my opinion) soccer players
and their stats and achievements over the course of their careers. I also have
gifs of some of their most memorable and spectacular moments that make me smile
every time I see them :).

    This table shows player statistics of what I believe to be some of the best soccer players
    that are past their prime (ages 30+) and will be retiring soon. I begin by defining
    a header letting the website viewer know the table below contains players and their
    stats. Sources for photos are given in the form of comments above the line of
    code relevant to them. The first row of the table provides a title for each column
    of the table, then rows under specify information based on the column's title it's under.

    Incredible moments from each of the players listed in the table above. One gif is present
    for each player showcasing one great moment they had during their career. This table creates
    a new row for each moment and all that is held in each row is the title (what the player does
    in addition to whom they are playing against) and the gif showing it. Each image has its own
    css class to define properties, the table has its own class as well for the same reason.
    See css/first_website.css for documentation on each. Sadly the sources did not work when
    I tried to link them in the form of comments so none are provided unlike the images above.
